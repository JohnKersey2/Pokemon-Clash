# Pokemon Clash!

## Active Development Notes

Develop function to populate a list of pokemon names for the autofill feature. If possible, find way to lock selections to only pokemon on that list. 

## Final Check Development Notes

Ensure code is refactored, images and text use accessable features. Remove excess .js/.css files. 

Update readme, wireframe, screenshot, and ensure repo name gets changed to correct name when finalized.

Create presentation and create script for presentation if needed. Make sure everyone knows when they speak.

## Project Description

Our project is a webpage users can use to compare two pokemon to find out which is stronger. We will be using two APIs. The first API is PokeAPI, which will allow us look up pokemon and some statistics about how strong they are. The second API is "Wikipedia API", which will allow us to take an image from a pokemon's wikipedia entry to display on our webpage, as well as provide a link to their page.

## User Story

AS A user who wants to beat my rival PokeTrainer
I WANT to compare two Pokemon to see which is stronger
SO THAT I can use data and statistics to quickly see if my Pokemon is stronger

## Work Flow

GIVEN When I want to compare two pokemon's strengths 
WHEN I type into one of the two text input areas
THEN I will be able to start typing a pokemon's name
WHEN I type a pokemon's name
THEN I will be assisted by autocomplete to ensure I get the correct data
WHEN I confirm a pokemon choice
THEN I will see an image of the pokemon appear
WHEN I have hit the two confirm buttons sucessfully
Then I will be able to click the fight button. 
WHEN I press the fight button
THEN I will be able to read a message telling me which pokemon is stronger
WHEN I am told which Pokemon is stronger
THEN I will be given images of trading cards to help me choose different Pokemon to test

## Known Issues

TBA 

Possibly incorrect name error. 

## Future Development

Displaying both pokeon's stats for the user to see

Allowing of multiple pokemon to be grouped together in teams to compare all 6 possible pokemon a trainer can have

Add in pokemon types to adjust stat values to account for weaknesses and resistences 

Adding in pokemon move lists and accounting for turn order to increase accuracy of results

Adding in customizable levels, moves, and other attributes that would affects relative strength

More detailed results messages, such as including what move a pokemon used to "Win" the fight.
