# project-number-one

I'm writing this the morning for the project to try and hit the ground running. I don't know what's going to be said by our instructor before we're plopped into our groups, so some of this may change or be redundant. I don't know how many people are going to be in the project, and it's going to change dramatically if there's 3 to a group or 6. 

## Initial Tasks

Brainstorm and come up with Project Concept that everyone is comfortable doing. While we do this, we need to keep in mind we have to use at least two server-side APIS and the website has to be interactive to a user. This dicussion should make sure everyone's voice is heard. DM me if you're too shy or don't want the social pressure of trying to say no or point out a major flaw in our idea, I'm more than happy to bring it up for you anonymously. 

Seek feedback with TA about our project concept as soon as possible. They may be able to tell us if the project is beyond what we can do, too narrow in scope, not novel enough, or any sort of pitfall we may have not thought of. If we have to pivot, we should do it as early as possible to avoid wasting time. 

Figure out what platforms work best for communicaiton and collaboration (slack, zoom, discord, etc).

Discuss if we wish to make a coordinated time to work on project outside of class periods or just work seperately and commit as we finish work. 

## Divy Up Work

Breakdown the project the best we can into discreet chunks. We won't know exactly what we'll need until we create a project, and how many people will split the work, so I'm just spitballing here. 

Style - Someone to first create a concept (or multiple concepts) for the website layout, color scheme, etc, to bring to the group. Once we agree on the projects design, they can figure out and implement the CSS framework we need. 

Create Functionality for API 1

Create Functionality for API 2 

Merging code, refactoring, and additional coding tasks

Additionally --- 

Creating our Presentation - While we all have to speak during the presentation, it's probably best to have a single person create this and discuss with members where they should speak. 

Figure out Leader / Point Person - I'm more than comfortable stepping up into that role. I have less family/work/life commitments than most and I have a lot of management experience. I'm also more than comfortable having someone else step up in the role if they think they are well suited to it. 

Lastly, we need to figure out deadlines for individual pieces and final contributions.

## Project Considerations: 

Work load should be a little fluid. If we think using a particular API is going to be 20% of the total work, and it only takes 5% of the work, while styling the website takes way more work than anticipated, we should adjust. It's in our best interests to help each other out. If you're finished or you're going to finish very early with "your section", see how you can help because it's "our project" being graded. 

Collaboration is 10% of our grade. That portion only has one line and should pay attention to the wording. "No major disparities in the NUMBER of GitHub contributions" may be something we have to keep in mind. With how central grading works, whomever takes the leadership role is going to have to keep an eye out on how many times certain people commit. I am a person who probably commits to much, and likely someone here commits only a couple of times between start and finish. Committing and code total is probably the only way the grader can tell what work we've put in, so we have to keep that in mind for whomever deals with external work like reviewing others code or prepping for the presentation 

## Useful Notes

Try to utilize "let" as often as you can instead of relying on "var". With function and global scoped variables, people may try to manipulate in different ways that break our code. This can be a massive source of frustration for us, and it's something we really need to learn as we begin program with collaborators.

Git Stash: I found a command in Git called "git stash". This allows you stash away local changes you've made to code when you need to make pull from the main branch. In a nutshell, you navigate to the repo in git, add your files, then "git stash". When you git pull, VSCode will then show you changes from the main branch to your code, and allow you to compare changes and choose which you'd like to keep. For safety, until you get comfortable with it, if you've put in a lot of work before pulling from the main branch, I'd keep a backup somewhere else, but stash should be pretty helpful.
